# GifTastic - Used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with music gifs based on artist or band name. Used JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML page.
Created an array of strings.
Take the topics in the array and create buttons in the HTML.
Appends a button for each string in the array using a loop.
When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.
Added a form to the page that takes the value from a user input and adds it to the topics array. 
Made a function call that takes each topic in the array and remakes the buttons on the page.
